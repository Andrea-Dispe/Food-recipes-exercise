# Food recipes exercise



This project was made to practice with React avoiding to use any backend and db and to practive to use useContext hook to pass data to the components. 

The app has 2 pages:

1. Main page which has a carousel of clickable images of recipes on the top, a form to add recipes (saved in the browser), and a recipes galleries styled as cards. Each card in the gallery and each image in the carousel are links to the individual recipe page.
2. Recipe page shows all the information about an individual recipe .
